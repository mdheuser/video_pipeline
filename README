In my real-world scenarionm, this project was created for a specific purpose so it
became messy. After automatically detecting frames with words and deleting them,
I also spent long hours scouring the selected frames for any that might have slipped 
detection.

The version I am presenting here is simplified. It generates
a video at the end without human interference.
